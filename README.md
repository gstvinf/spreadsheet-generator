# spreadsheet-generator

## How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/gstvinf/spreadsheet-generator.git
cd spreadsheet-generator
```

Past your `file 000.xlsx` in that project or create a folder to put your files.

You must use 3 numbers at the end of your files's name.

If you want to use a folder, edit that line with your folder's name and past your `file 000.xlsx` inside that folder

``` javascript
const folderName = 'MyFolder';
```

After that, you can install and play

```
npm install
npm start
```

See the magic!
